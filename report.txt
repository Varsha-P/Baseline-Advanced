Assignment 3 Report

Name: VARSHA PATTIPATI

1. What I turned in, what it does, and how to run it

ANSWER:	I have used the functions from hw3_corpus_tool.py in both create_baseline_features.py and create_advanced_features.py to read the csv files. I called the get_utterances_from_filename function on the file specified in the argument.

BASH.txt: This file has the BASH commands(TO BE RUN IN THE COMMAND PROMPT) used for appending results from multiple files into one which is then given as input to CRFsuite.


2. How I evaluated my baseline and advanced features

ANSWER:	I used k-fold cross-validation to evaluate both baseline and advanced features with k=3. 
CRFsuite has an option to perform k-fold cross-validation with the following command:
	crfsuite learn -g3 -x trainfile.txt   (for 3-fold validation)
It gives the accuracy after each fold. I calculated the average of the accuracies obtained to evaluated my features.

3. Description of advanced feature set

ANSWER:	a.) I have used tri-grams to generate features for the advanced part of the homework. For example, if the dialogue utterance is "Bruno is my dog", my baseline feature features are 'token_Bruno', 'token_is', 'token_my' and 'token_dog'.
But my advanced- feature features would be 'token___token___token_Bruno', 'token___token_Bruno_token_is', 'token_Bruno_token_is_token_my', 'token_is_token_my_token_dog', 'token_my_token_dog_token__', and 'token_dog_token___token__'
b.) I also used the pos tags, speaker changed and first occurance features in my advanced features


4. How I developed my advanced feature set

ANSWER:	I kept track of the previous two tokens in the dialogue sequence using two variables a and b. Initial values of both a and b are "token__". I changed them at the end of every iteration ie., a becomes b and b becomes the current token in the loop. The statement  print(a+'_'+b+'_'+word,end="\t")   would then print the tri-grams required.
PS: 'word' is the current token in the loop.


5. Results

ANSWER:	Accuracy of baseline features: 72.89% (fold1: 73.02%, fold2: 72.83%, fold3: 72.82%)
	Accuracy of advanced features: 73.98% (fold1: 73.95%, fold2: 73.73%, fold3: 74.27%)
